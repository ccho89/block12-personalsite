     <div className='description'>
        <p>I am an introverted extrovert who is always ready to try new things and create lasting memories!</p>
        <p>This journey of discovering and learning code has been challenging to say the least. This test of self-resilience has been a HUGE learning process for me, a challenge that I am still working hard to overcome. I can only hope to one day become an accomplished developer through hard work and show off my skills!</p>
